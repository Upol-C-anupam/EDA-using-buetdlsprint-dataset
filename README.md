# EDA-using-buetdlsprint-dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is one of the techniques used for extracting vital features and trends used by machine learning and deep learning models in Dta Science.
Exploratory Data Analysis is an essential step for understanding the data that we are working on it helps us in identifying any hidden pattern in the data, the correlation
between different columns of the data, and analyzing the properties of the data.

In this case, I have developed a notebook to learn EDA, I have used the dataset from this paper -->https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14053

Getting a comprehensive idea about Exploratory Data Analysis is the purpose of the work.
